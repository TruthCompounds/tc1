  <p>What or whoever one is attached to, is ones master. — Kapil Gupta</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My Father is my master. <br />
Cigarettes are my masters. <br />
My “Friends” are my masters. <br />
My sisters are my masters.<br />
My Mom is my master.</p>

<p>My Brother is very sweet.</p>

<p>I’m allowing myself to be a slave. I’m choosing to be a slave. I’m choosing to be a slave to my fear. Of the fear of survival, I like to believe. But really I’m just a coward. I’m uncomfortable changing the environment, so I became a bussy. A bussy is a familiar pussy. One that you have given up on changing.</p>

<p>Where is Freedom? <br />
Where can I go to find freedom? <br />
I guess I have to move out. <br />
Freedom has to be found within, but I’m too lazy to do it. I’m too unmotivated to do it. I’m too much of a bussy to do it. Programs have taken me over. Others have made me their slave. I have allowed others to be my masters. The causes go way back. They are buried deep within. Insecurities have to be seen and let go. Fears have to be seen and let go of. I am that I am. I don’t need permission from anyone.</p>

<p>I do care for freedom. Freedom was the motivation behind some of the most rebellious and important decisions I have made in my entire life. Freedom really is one of the fundamental causes behind everything I do. It’s likely it underlies 80% of my actions and decisions. It is likely I have had It all wrong, thinking I do things out of Love or Truth. Really, I think I do them because I want to be free. And maybe I’m afraid of testing my assumption that freedom is going to bring me peace, and that’s the reason I’m avoiding leaving home and building my financial independence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Freedom is Freedom from the Mind — Kapil Gupta</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m the cause behind many of the most important, life-changing occurrences that happen in my life. What am I, and what is my Life? I don’t want to have to answer to anyone. I don’t want to be responsible for anyone. I don’t want to be obliged to anyone.</p>

				<p>CHILL</p>

<p>CHILL CHILL</p>

<p>I Don’t write much.</p>

<p>Mind yaps a lot.</p>

<p>Truth kills you.</p>

<p>All selves are destined to Unite.</p>

<p>The Bible has its roots in Astrology.</p>

<p>I am still bound in shackles.</p>

<p>What is Letting Go really?</p>

<p>Do we need Books and Techniques?</p>

<p>What can I not let go of?</p>

<p>What If I did let go of wanting to be great?</p>

<p>What If I did let go of wanting to survive?</p>

<p>What If I did let go of being run by fear?</p>

<p>What If I followed my heart no matter where It may take me?</p>

<p>What If I replaced the fear of death with only Truth?</p>

<p>What if there was no difference between anything?</p>

<p>What is Fear? and why do we avoid it?</p>

<p>What is the pain hidden away in my gut?</p>

<p>How can I stop being run by Fear?</p>

<p>Is a Life without Fear possible?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All Fear is Fear of Oneself</p>

  <p>– Kapil Gupta, MD</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you do with Fear?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Uproot it (Letting Go) (Head On)</li>
  <li>Be Present and Understand where it comes from (stroll)</li>
  <li>Vibrate with a high frequency to avoid being controlled by it</li>
</ul>

<p>All three necessitate being Present with the feeling and not avoiding it in any way.</p>

<p>Where is the Heart and Mind in the Letting Go technique?</p>

<p>Maybe I should actually finish reading the damn book?</p>

<p>My Inkling is that just concentrating on feeling the emotion can amplify It and does not actually resolve it. What resolves it is a recontextualization of the feeling in the present context. So feeling the emotion, yes, but also not losing awareness of everything around it, the whole body, thoughts and the outside.</p>

<p>Or is fear and stored pain just a message from the past that is resolved by understanding the message?</p>

<p>Or is fear resolved by becoming one with it? Not trying to get rid of it?</p>

<p>To live without fear one has to let go of all fears. That seems obvious. -&gt; Let’s presume the opposite, that you <strong>can</strong> live without fear, but buried deep within there still is the fear of death. In that case, since we live in a world with threat in it, that fear will get triggered anyways.</p>

<p>But Alan Watts and the Zen are saying that ultimately, the fear comes from within. That the mind creates it. Yes, threat exists, danger exists, but we have the power to interpret it in any way we want to. And so we can fear it and act based on that emotion, or we can become present and not let circumstance cause any self-inflicted pain.</p>

<p>I used to self-inflict so much pain.</p>

<p>I blamed myself and made myself suffer because I didn’t know any other way to deal with major problems.</p>

<p>I was anxious in social situations.</p>

<p>I was anxious in most of school.</p>

<p>I had to suppress anxiousness for hours on end. Day after day. I guess that <strong>is</strong> part of the deep buried pain.</p>

<p>I guess that made it easier to tolerate fear and anxiousness in the future. I am sure it is not the optimal solution.</p>

<p>Let’s see what Letting Go Chapter about Fear says.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Unconscious is crude and uncivilized. Symbols of the Unconscious are just Symbols. ???</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We hold an unconscious belief that fear keeps us alive, when in reality the opposite is true. Fear keeps us from being alive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What Concrete Fears do I have?</p>

<ul>
  <li>That someone will get angry at me and murder me</li>
  <li>That I will get laughed at by people</li>
  <li>That I’ll let myself down</li>
  <li>That I will get judged by my appearance</li>
  <li>That I will self-inflict more pain.</li>
  <li>That I’ll feel fear</li>
  <li>That I’ll feel pain and suffer</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Guilt accompanies all negative emotions and throws one out of balance and makes them weaker.</p>

  <p>Guilt is a substitute for reality and almost always has nothing to do with the truth of the situation.</p>

  <p>Disease is unlikely to exist without guilt and guilt is a denial of our inner intrinsic innocence.</p>

  <p>Guilt and self-inflicted pain are programmed in us by society. The Truth is, it is only there to keep us down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am arrogant.</p>

<p>I avoid getting to the bottom of contradictions in me.</p>

<p>I avoid admitting my ignorance.</p>

<p>I fear fear.</p>

<p>I fear feeling the pain and not getting anywhere. I fear suffering unnecessarily. I haven’t become convinced of our inner innocence.</p>

<p>I predict more dark traumas lurking beneath the pain in my stomach I call the black hole.</p>

  <p>When one fully realizes that most prior meaning making was socially and culturally conditioned, scientific certainty and the judgmental frame of mind break down. <strong>Moreover, Individualists can learn to consciously scrutinize their beliefs in order to test their assumptions or to relish the novel mental freedom such a maneuver opens up.</strong> A big discovery for this stage is the relativity of points of view. When people first become aware of this, they may see everything as relative and reject any prior certainties including scientific knowledge as absolute and therefore “false.” It takes experience at this stage to realize that successful living likely requires some of the earlier values. Most individuals need to make a living to survive. Sticking with a job one may not totally like and getting along with others who do not appreciate constant questioning is thus a requirement for most adults no matter how creative and postconventional one may be.</p>

  <p>– Suzanne Cook-Greuter (Ego Development: A Full-Spectrum Theory Of Vertical Growth And Meaning)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to believe mental freedom isn‘t dependent on whether you’re in a jail cell or on a planet by yourself, but I think it <strong>is</strong> dependent on wether one uses all resources available to him to live and express freedom to the highest degree he understands it. Otherwise, he will forever be the victim of his own self-imposed limitations, because, I can’t imagine a person experiencing true freedom and not longing for it ever after. The feeling of true freedom is natures biggest gift.</p>

<p>I packed some <em>more</em> stuff. and realized I have been buying stuff for no reason except immediate emotional satisfaction. And then those items I keep and they keep burdening, tying down and weighing on me. I will get rid of most of my stuff. Can’t bother donating or selling. I’m too unsure to talk to people.</p>

				<p>A huge mistake i’ve been making is trying to avoid pain and suffering by not going all the way when telling the truth. I’ve always resorted to telling the truth when the suffering was already overdue and even then I didn’t tell the truth just as it is just to avoid inflicting pain either on others or myself. I said partial truths, I didn’t go all the way in saying what I thought. I approached the truth from one side but never really got to it. I avoided circling the truth to zero in on it. This is a bit abstract but those are the images my mind throws. I avoided telling the whole truth of my thoughts because that made me vulnerable. Because then there would arise the possibility of me being wrong. Of me starting a fire that wasn’t necessary.</p>

<p>I am afraid to tell the truth because It might turn out I’m wrong or inaccurate. Maybe wrong isn’t applicable because I tried to tell the truth and so just the pursuit of truth can’t ever be wrong. Just as no other pursuit can be wrong. It depends on the one judging. And if you take society as the ultimate judge, and society says you’re wrong and cancels you so you can’t speak anymore, then that is just how the mob is.</p>

<p>You know, writing can really make my self-contradictions apparent. Self-contradictions are the worst when you’re trying to get to the Truth. But they are useful when you are trying to live in ignorance. Maybe blindfolded bliss. Blindfolded bliss was fun until I realized that the tradeoff was wasting my life.</p>

<p>I am sick of wasting my life. I am sick of being dependent and caged. Being unfree. I will free myself. I will make myself great. I will create something I’m proud of and I’ll do it without anyone’s permission. I will go and live my life. I will live for myself. I will honor and respect truth.</p>

<p>I feel lonely. I feel lonely. I feel lonley and sad. I feel more lonely when I’m not alone because I’m more distanced from myself when I’m surrounded by others. I don’t know how to remove societal programming. How can I get away from society? How can I get away from everybody? How can I confront my bullshit in its entirety? How can I admit the truth that is in me once and for all? How can I become myself? What I thought I was I often was not. I do not know what I am. I know I defend myself. I believe I’m an organism. How can I be truthful? How can I be truthful in the moment? How can I make the decision? Do I have the power to make a decision? How can I conquer the mind?</p>

<p>Where am I using perscriptions?</p>

  <p>What or whoever one is attached to, is ones master. — Kapil Gupta</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My Father is my master. <br />
Cigarettes are my masters. <br />
My “Friends” are my masters. <br />
My sisters are my masters.<br />
My Mom is my master.</p>

<p>My Brother is very sweet.</p>

<p>I’m allowing myself to be a slave. I’m choosing to be a slave. I’m choosing to be a slave to my fear. Of the fear of survival, I like to believe. But really I’m just a coward. I’m uncomfortable changing the environment, so I became a bussy. A bussy is a familiar pussy. One that you have given up on changing.</p>

<p>Where is Freedom? <br />
Where can I go to find freedom? <br />
I guess I have to move out. <br />
Freedom has to be found within, but I’m too lazy to do it. I’m too unmotivated to do it. I’m too much of a bussy to do it. Programs have taken me over. Others have made me their slave. I have allowed others to be my masters. The causes go way back. They are buried deep within. Insecurities have to be seen and let go. Fears have to be seen and let go of. I am that I am. I don’t need permission from anyone.</p>

<p>I do care for freedom. Freedom was the motivation behind some of the most rebellious and important decisions I have made in my entire life. Freedom really is one of the fundamental causes behind everything I do. It’s likely it underlies 80% of my actions and decisions. It is likely I have had It all wrong, thinking I do things out of Love or Truth. Really, I think I do them because I want to be free. And maybe I’m afraid of testing my assumption that freedom is going to bring me peace, and that’s the reason I’m avoiding leaving home and building my financial independence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Freedom is Freedom from the Mind — Kapil Gupta</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m the cause behind many of the most important, life-changing occurrences that happen in my life. What am I, and what is my Life? I don’t want to have to answer to anyone. I don’t want to be responsible for anyone. I don’t want to be obliged to anyone.</p>

				<p><strong>What does justifying my actions lead me to?</strong><br />
Being away from the present</p>

<p>What does interpretation of my actions lead me to?</p>

<p>Truth? How can it lead to truth if my interpretation is dictated solely by my past?</p>

<p>Even the very words with which my mind labels my experience are the results of every past interpretation of that word before it reached my mind.</p>

<p>And the interpretation of a word also strongly depends on the context of that word:<br />
1) The environment <br />
2) The Sentence, Paragraph.. <br />
3) Where that word comes from, in terms of the experience of another mind (What I think the other person would mean by that word, consciously and unconsciously? From where in the Mind does it come from? Does it come from me? Does it come from the 2nd Person? Does it come from a 3rd Person? Is it grounded in Tradition? Does it come from media? From Biased Media? From Media that is influenced by evil agendas of influential people? From supposed good (selfish) agendas of influential people? Are those people decidedly evilor are they ultimately still doing it out of love and might it be the case that my judgement of their actions is also the pure result of my capacity to love? Can it be the case that in order for “evil” people to be more loving, I have to become more loving myself and that that is the only way for them to become more loving? Is deleting “evil” people as easy as to understand that their actions are just a limited form of love? Is everything either less or more love? What is less or more love? Isn’t that dependent on interpretation the same? But all of us knows more love and less love, isn’t it? Would the Worst Human still differentiate more and less love? Is love all frequencies? Are there frequencies without love? Is there anything without Love? Consciousness? No. Consciousness is, by definition, that which is shared by everything and so, unnamable and ungraspable. But some conscious states or experiences are colored differently. They contain less Self-Love, they are more contracted, limited, caged, parts are tied down and hidden away in the shadows of the subconscious. So, What is causing those limitations of awareness, of the mind? Society? Survival Bias? mind? Mind? Me? Who is creating the problem? Society? my biased mind? the Universal Mind(does this really exist or is the mind a limited version of the Mind? are they just subset/superset? is my mind just the border around my mind that keeps it from becoming the Mind? What else could be between my mind and the Mind other than my mind? Could it be my self-image, self-understanding that is keeping me from expanding to being the Mind?)<br />
I think I believe to need to have done certain things in the world (for society? in society? for myself but programmed by society? just programmed by society? remnants of my past beliefs? my past goals and what I believed I ought to be?) and that is keeping me from expanding. I have these expectations to satisfy which don’t come from me. They could come from <br />
    1) Family <br />
    2) Friends<br />
    3) Gurus<br />
    4) People on the internet<br />
    5) Society<br />
    6) Idols<br />
    7) from me in the past<br />
    8) …</p>

<p>They don’t come from me, and I know I shouldn’t subscribe to them but still they torment me. Those expectations generate enormous suffering in the form of the mind saying “you’re not enough”. It’s not even saying it anymore, it’s expecting it. It’s deeper than my conscious most of the time. It comes from a place I don’t consciously explore. It comes up and says it must be followed in order for it, and whatever caused it, to survive. What caused it? What is it? What is that feeling and urge of following the familiar pitfall caused by? Why can’t I just decide to never follow the familiar pitfall? What is the cause of the familiar pitfall? How can a familiar pitfall disguise itself as a solution to a new problem? as a new problem? Is internal conflict about a problem just another problem and is it possible that it can never solve the problem? Can no problem be solved? Can problems only be understood? Solving the problem is understanding the problem? Steps to solving the problem don’t bring anyone further? Should I never articulate how I solved a problem? Or, rather, how I understood the cause of the problem? Are all causes within? Am I whole? Is there no problem, just misunderstanding?</p>

<p><strong>Old Habit and how the mind functions</strong></p>

<p>Does the mind create experience or does it color it? Is mind and experience, awareness different?</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is a habit to base one’s decisions on the likely future.</li>
  <li>the mind has lots of programs. programs are reactions. they are unconscious. What I want is to be conscious instead of running programs. But prescriptions don’t work. I can’t force myself to be conscious. I can’t prescribe myself to do anything. All I can do is understand. All I want to do is not having to do anything. I want the future to feel open, then it might feel exciting and I might do something new. When I try to not have to do anything, I still default to doing what I think I have to do. I have internalized expectations. <br />
1) I have to become financially free. <br />
2) I have to be a decent human. <br />
3) I have to contribute to society. <br />
4) I have to act morally. <br />
5) I have to love.<br />
6) I have to maintain my ego. My self. My self-image. My beliefs. My selfishness. My greatness. Myself. Or risk what?</li>
  <li>Not using my potential</li>
  <li>Wasting my potential</li>
  <li>Getting shunned and judged by society</li>

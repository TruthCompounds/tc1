Of course I am. 

How can I not be. I was born a son of slaves in a society of slaves. In a place where truth costs money, survival costs freedom, thriving necessitates lies. 

What am I waiting for? Why am I not following my heart and going against all conventions to be sovereign. 

Everyone and everything that’s keeping me from being sovereign must be abandoned. 

The Luxuries of the Home must be left behind and familiar people have to be ghosted. 

People will be upset and lonely. People will blame me for their pain. People will curse me. People may be let down. People may be disappointed. 

People **will** be disappointed.

I have not taken responsibility for their well-being. 

How can I let down my family? 

Why should I let down my family? 

What am I to do? 

Is serving the Truth selfish? 

What if my self is distorting the Truth? 

My self is absolutely distorting the Truth. 

Why am I carrying others voices in my head? 

Which voice is the honest one? 

Why is being honest and vulnerable so hard? 

This kind of coughin don’t need lean. 

Where is the wink of the universe?

Not knowing anything is direct freedom. And not knowing continuously must be the shortest path to Truth. Not knowing anything for sure is the surest Truth you can know. Anything I question enough brings me to not knowing. The knowing is the illusion. It is the biggest Illusion.
Homie leave me be. Home let go of attachment to other people.

I packed some *more* stuff. and realized I have been buying stuff for no reason except immediate emotional satisfaction. And then those items I keep and they keep burdening, tying down and weighing on me. I will get rid of most of my stuff. Can't bother donating or selling. I'm too unsure to talk to people.

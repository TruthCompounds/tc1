> When one fully realizes that most prior meaning making was socially and culturally conditioned, scientific certainty and the judgmental frame of mind break down. **Moreover, Individualists can learn to consciously scrutinize their beliefs in order to test their assumptions or to relish the novel mental freedom such a maneuver opens up.** A big discovery for this stage is the relativity of points of view. When people first become aware of this, they may see everything as relative and reject any prior certainties including scientific knowledge as absolute and therefore “false.” It takes experience at this stage to realize that successful living likely requires some of the earlier values. Most individuals need to make a living to survive. Sticking with a job one may not totally like and getting along with others who do not appreciate constant questioning is thus a requirement for most adults no matter how creative and postconventional one may be.

I want to believe mental freedom isn‘t dependent on whether you’re in a jail cell or on a planet by yourself, but I think it **is** dependent on wether one uses all resources available to him to live and express freedom to the highest degree he understands it. Otherwise, he will forever be the victim of his own self-imposed limitations, because, I can’t imagine a person experiencing true freedom and not longing for it ever after. The feeling of true freedom is natures biggest gift.

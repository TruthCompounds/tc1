Internalized voices. 

The Truth is always just there. There is no way to get closer to it or to understand it or do anything about it. You can either appreciate it or do anything else you want. You choose. No difference in the end. We all die. 



F Society.

F Language.

The programming has to be dropped at a certain point. 

At a certain point, the programming has to be dropped. 

What if I was born in a family that lived by the Truth. Like in the Countryside growing its own food? > Then I'd be an alien not understanding people. 

You have to grow out of society. Even though it's despicable with making you believe lies, you have to learn its ropes if you want to understand it. If you want to use it to your advantage, say, sell a product, you have to have learned it. 

You get paid for providing VALUE. 

You can provide VALUE to 1 Person/Entity -> Job

You can provide VALUE to a type of Person (avatar) (group) -> Niche Business

<u>Eventually</u> You provide VALUE to everybody because your contribution *dissipates*.

### <u>Money</u>

F TradFi. We doing EthFi where you can actually see money. 

What about Monero and money privacy? 

You know, money could use a nice reimagigning. 

What is Money, Finance and Economics?

How does traditional economics work? How is crypto different? 

How long do I need to read Taleb's Incerto? 1 Month? Maybe 37 Days? 



Is being Great enough, or do you have to be able to explain the how..? > Fuck the explaining (voice), be great, people will appreciate you. Kanye can't explain himself.. But he, in contrast to you, has a grind to go back to. And eventually the grind sharpens the blade sharper than any sperm and egg could. 

NO PERSCRIPTIONS IS THE ONLY PERSCRIPTION WHICH HAS TO BE NOED EVENTUALLY ASWELL..

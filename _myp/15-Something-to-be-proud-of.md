Time is of the Essence! 

There is so much more to learn, teach and create... More Knowledge and Understanding is needed to create something good and valuable and unique. 

I'm going back, away from problems. Slowly dismantling the causes of my sufferings only later to wander once again into problems of the Mind. 

His demands in exchange for peace are quite the challenge. 

Best way to get rid of attachment is to understand it and so be free from it. 

No "doing" is necessary, realise that you already are.

Your non-attachment will become externally apparent in due time. 

I have not written anything truly original. Maybe ever. 

Why am I even doing this? It won't be of any use. I'm killing time. 

All that I want I can't have because I believe not to have it and All that I really want I already have. 

Why can't I just be honest ~

Why are some things hard to do? 

I wanted the Wizard Life to be easy

I KNOW it doesn't have to be hard, I can make it whatever I want. 

I take in Info, I take in Symbols, I take in Experience, but I don't know what to do with it. I feel like I'm supposed to productise it or document it or capture it... Make money off it or get inspired by it - create something out of it and store it away on some cloud server only to look at it after a while and feel delight for myself for coming this far and not quitting and staying true to myself. 

What should I base my decisions on when writing? I want to be compassionate, care for every reader, clear, simple...

I want to let the konschiousness flow like my bro Jodorowsky says. 

I want to be sincere and self-aware and conscious of my shortcomings. At the same time dedicated to my craft and willing to make the sacrifice.
